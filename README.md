The application provides a simple interface to select all the alarms you want (one option for every quarter hour of the day). Once the alarms are set the next step is to add any exercise you want.
The application is meant to encourage virtous behaviours so try adding exercises you think you and if you can't complete them go as far as possible. 
Try to push yourself (not too much, consistency is the way to go) as the weeks go by and add harder exercises to keep up the challenge.
